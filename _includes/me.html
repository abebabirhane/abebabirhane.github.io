    I am a cognitive scientist researching human behaviour, 
    social systems, and responsible and ethical Artificial Intelligence (AI). 
    I recently finished my PhD, where I explored the challenges and pitfalls of 
    automating human behaviour through critical examination of existing computational models 
    and audits of large scale datasets.

      I am currently a Senior Fellow in Trustworthy AI at 
      <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/" target="_blank">  Mozilla Foundation</a>. 
      I am an interdisciplinary researcher 
      and my research interests sit at the intersection of 
      cognitive science, AI, complex science, 
      and theories of decoloniality.  
      I am also an Adjunct Lecturer/Assistant Professor at 
      the School of Computer Science at <a href="https://www.ucd.ie/collegesandschools/science/computerscience/" target="_blank">
