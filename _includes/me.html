<p>Hi, I am a research scientist at the <a href="http://rise.org.cy/">Research Centre on Interactive Media, Smart Systems and Emerging Technologies</a> (RISE), Cyprus and <a href="//bradlove.org/">Prof. Bradley C. Love</a>'s lab in the <a href="//www.ucl.ac.uk/pals/research/experimental-psychology/person/olivia-guest/">Department of Experimental Psychology</a>, University College London.</p>
<p>My undergraduate degree was in <a href="https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/undergraduate/ug-courses/bsc-cs/">Computer Science</a>. After that, I moved on to an <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/pals/study/masters/TMSPSYSCDS01">MSc in Cognitive and Decision Sciences</a>. I then undertook a <a href="http://www.bbk.ac.uk/psychology/">PhD in Psychology</a> on <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1210206">computational models for semantic memory</a>.</p>
<p>My current research primarily involves the creation and evaluation of computational accounts — such as deep and shallow artificial neural networks — for categorisation and conceptual representation in healthy adults, patient groups, infants, and animal models. I also have interests in computational modelling and data science more broadly, e.g., <a href="http://redistrict.science">redistrict.science</a>.</p>
<p>I am an <a href="http://rescience.github.io/board/">associate editor</a> at <a href="http://rescience.github.io/">ReScience C</a> and a <a href="https://joss.theoj.org/about#topic_editors">topic editor</a> at <a href="https://joss.theoj.org/">Journal of Open Source Software</a>. I am committed to equity, diversity, and inclusion in (open) science, e.g., <a href="https://neuroplausible.com/programming">promoting access to technical skills training</a>. In addition, <a href="https://www.mpi.nl/people/bergmann-christina">Christina Bergmann</a> and I try to maintain a <a href="http://compcog.science/">list of underrepresented cognitive computational scientists</a>. I also <a href="//neuroplausible.com">blog</a> about my research and opinions on computational cognitive science and related fields.</p>
